Power supply is four 3V lithium cells.

Mechanical:

The rotary encoder is connected directly to the central drive shaft (via a set of plastic gear wheels).

The motor drives the drive shaft via an automatic clutch that engages when the motor changes direction. All gears between the motor and the drive shaft are metal.
